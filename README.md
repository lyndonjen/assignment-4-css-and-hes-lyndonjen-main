## Tip:  David's solution 

David's approach to a solution uses CSS Flex, and uses the following CSS properties.  Don't treat this list as a requirement -- you don't have to use all of these CSS properties.  Don't treat this list as a constraint -- you aren't limited to these properties.  I present it to give you a sense of the properties I used for a solution, and I give it to you to encourage curiousity of properties you may not otherwise encounter.
